# Simple manga reader

This is a simple manga reader. Uses nuxt and the mangadex api. I wrote this in a day so don't expect everything to work/look good. 

I created it because current manga reader websites have too much ui around the reader and are generally shit to use. This one is also shit to use, just less so.

## How to use
```
bun dev --host
```
to start a dev server. Scan the generated qr code to try it on the phone.

# Simple manga reader

This is a simple manga reader. Uses nuxt and the mangadex api. I wrote this in a day so don't expect everything to work/look good. 

I created it because current manga reader websites have too much ui around the reader and are generally shit to use. This one is also shit to use, just less so.

## How to use
```
bun dev 
```
then just follow instructions in the console.

## Mobile
Mobile does not really work because of the proxy. I'm still working on fixing the issue.
